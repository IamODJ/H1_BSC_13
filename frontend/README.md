## Running the project locally:

1. Clone the `main` branch.
2. Make a new branch from `main`
3. In the `bosch-frontend` directory, run:
   `npm install` to install all dependencies.
4. To host the project locally, run: `npm start` 
5. Let us work on one component at a time. Make a folder corresponding to your component in Components directory.
This folder should have a js file and css file corresponding to the component.
6. To render your component, import it in App.js and add it in the `render` function.
